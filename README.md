This repository contains my solution for the clothing classifier task as part of the ML Engineer position at [Company Name].

## Problem Statement

The task is to build a classifier for clothing articles. Given an input image of a clothing item, the model should predict the corresponding class or category.

## Approach

1. **Data Collection**: Describe how you collected the dataset for training and evaluation. Include details such as the number of classes, the total number of images, and any data augmentation techniques used.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Explain the steps taken to preprocess the data, such as resizing the images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Mention any additional preprocessing techniques applied.

3. **Model Architecture**: Provide an overview of the chosen model architecture for the clothing classifier. If you used a pre-trained model, mention the specific model and any modifications made. Include the number of parameters in the model.

4. **Training**: Describe the training process, including the optimization algorithm used, the learning rate schedule, the batch size, and the number of training epochs. Mention any regularization techniques applied, such as dropout or weight decay.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Clearly state the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the classifier. Explain why you chose these metrics and their relevance to the problem at hand.

6. **Results**: Present the results of your tests, including the accuracy or other relevant metrics achieved on the testing set. Provide insights into the performance of the classifier and any observations made during evaluation.

## Receptive Field

Discuss the overall receptive field of your model. Explain how receptive field size impacts the model's ability to capture global and local information in the images. Provide examples to demonstrate the receptive field at different stages of the model.

Explain how the receptive field can be increased or decreased based on the model architecture or modifications.

## FLOPS and MACCs Calculation

Report the estimated or calculated number of FLOPS (floating-point operations) and MACCs (multiply-accumulate operations) per layer in your model, focusing mainly on the convolutional and fully connected layers. Highlight the most computationally expensive layers in terms of FLOPS and MACCs.

Discuss strategies to decrease the number of FLOPS and MACCs in the model, such as model pruning, quantization, or using alternative lightweight architectures. Provide examples to support your recommendations.

## Repository Structure

Describe the structure of your repository, including the organization of code files, data directories, and any additional resources. Provide instructions for running the code, reproducing the results, and any dependencies or package versions required.

## Conclusion

Summarize your approach, key findings, and any limitations or challenges faced during the development of the clothing classifier. Discuss possible future improvements or extensions to the model or evaluation process.
